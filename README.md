# Online Store Orders – Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an online store’s order data to uncover business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and operational trends. The analysis covers the full data lifecycle — from data loading and cleaning to SQL-style analysis, visualization, and insights generation.

The goal is to demonstrate practical **data analyst skills** using Python, pandas, SQL concepts, and data visualization.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **1,200 orders** with the following key attributes:

* Order details (OrderID, Date, OrderStatus)
* Product information (Product, Quantity, UnitPrice, TotalPrice)
* Customer & logistics data (CustomerID, ShippingAddress, TrackingNumber)
* Payment and marketing details (PaymentMethod, CouponCode, ReferralSource)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis workflow
* **SQL concepts** implemented using pandas (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY)

---

## 🧩 Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Data Loading

* Imported the Excel dataset into pandas
* Verified dataset structure, data types, and dimensions

---

### Task 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Checked for missing values and duplicates
* Retained missing `CouponCode` values as they indicate orders without discounts
* Converted date column to datetime format
* Created new features: **Year, Month, Day** for time-based analysis
* Performed data validation checks

---

### Task 3: SQL-Based Data Analysis

(SQL logic implemented using pandas)

* **SELECT**: Retrieved order-level details
* **WHERE**: Filtered delivered orders
* **GROUP BY + COUNT**: Order distribution by order status
* **GROUP BY + SUM**: Revenue generated by each product
* **GROUP BY + AVG + ORDER BY**: Average order value by payment method

---

### Task 4: Data Visualization

* Monthly revenue trend line chart
* Box plot to identify outliers in order revenue
* Pie chart to visualize categorical distribution (non-payment based)

---

### Task 5: Business Insights & KPIs

**Key KPIs:**

* Total Revenue: **1,264,761.96**
* Total Orders: **1,200**
* Average Order Value (AOV): **1,053.97**
* Median Order Value: **823.62**
* Total Quantity Sold: **3,535**
* Highest Single Order Value: **~3,400+**
* Lowest Order Value: **~50+**
* Revenue Range per Order: **Wide variance indicating mixed order sizes**
* Number of Unique Products: **7**
* Orders with Coupon Applied: **~74%**
* Orders without Coupon: **~26%**

**Insights:**

* Revenue fluctuates month-over-month, indicating seasonality or demand variation
* A small percentage of high-value orders significantly increases overall revenue
* Certain products (e.g., Laptop, Chair, Printer) contribute a disproportionately high share of total sales
* Credit Card payments show the highest average order value compared to other payment methods
* Order status distribution is fairly balanced, with Delivered, Cancelled, Returned, and Pending orders each contributing meaningful volume
* Presence of outliers suggests premium or bulk purchase behavior from select customers
* Monthly sales peaks indicate opportunities for targeted promotions during high-performing periods

---

## 📈 Key Takeaways

* Demonstrates end-to-end data analysis workflow
* Applies SQL querying logic in a Python environment
* Extracts actionable business insights from raw data
* Suitable for showcasing **entry-level Data Analyst skills**
